ICON GENERATION INSTRUCTIONS
============================

To generate the required icon files for this extension:

1. Open the file: ../generate-icons.html in your web browser
2. Click each download button to generate the icons:
   - Download 16x16 → Save as icon16.png
   - Download 48x48 → Save as icon48.png
   - Download 128x128 → Save as icon128.png
3. Place all three PNG files in this directory (assets/icons/)

Alternatively, you can create your own custom icons using any design tool.
Just make sure they are PNG files with the exact dimensions:
- icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
- icon48.png (48x48 pixels)
- icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

The default generated icons feature a simple clock design in the extension's
earth-tone color palette (terracotta background with off-white clock).
