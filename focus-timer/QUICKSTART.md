## Tips for Maximum Productivity

- **Start with 25-minute sessions** (Pomodoro technique)
- **Common domains to block:** reddit.com, twitter.com, facebook.com, youtube.com, instagram.com, tiktok.com
- **Create different presets** for different work modes:
  - "Deep Work" - block all social media
  - "Writing Mode" - block news and social
  - "Research Mode" - lighter blocking
- **Remember:** The timer clears on browser restart (intentional fresh start each day)

## Troubleshooting

**Overlay not showing?**
- Make sure you refreshed the page after starting the timer
- Check that the domain is in your blocked list
- Verify the timer is still active (check the popup)

**Can't add a domain?**
- Use just the domain name: `reddit.com` (not `https://www.reddit.com/r/all`)
- No www, no https, no paths

**Timer disappeared?**
- This is normal if you restarted your browser
- Set a new timer when you're ready to focus again

**You're all set! Stay focused and do important work.**
